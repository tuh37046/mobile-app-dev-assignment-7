# Lab 6: Language and Localization
This app is built on what we did in Assignment 5. The user is prompted to select a fruit from a GridView containing 4 different options.  Upon making a selection, an activity is launched that displays the full-size fruit in a more appropriate layout.  After selecting a fruit, the user can use the back button to return to the selection menu.  However, in this lab, French-speaking users can set their device language to French, and the app will use French localized strings.
